Nightly Builds
==============

Since ~10/2015 domodroid is develop with Android Studio.

It's no more true until we find time an volunteer to make it works.

Nightly builds were Android apk available at:

http://repo.domogik.org/domodroid-nightly/

They're build every night and can be build by developers at any time with a special link.

You should use the last one to be sure having last update.


If you find a bug or want an evolution don't forget to tell us which version it is.

You can user the Tracker at: https://github.com/domogik/domodroid/issues to submit anythings.
