Map system
==========

Creation of the "Domodroid" directory at the root of the external storage directory (or internal for some specific devices), maps have to be put in this directory.

* Zoom: 2 fingers pinch

* Drag: 2 fingers move

* Change map: 3 fingers tap

* Longclick on map allow you to add/move/remove a widget directly from where or what you put finger on.
 
* Add a map directly from the map view with the android internal image picker.

    Multi-touch gesture (Zoom, Drag, Change Map, Hide text, Block map edition) can be activated from the "MAP Options" screen. 

Gesture activation must be activated only on powerful devices otherwise Domodroid will certainly crashes. Bitmap rezising might cause OutOfMemory exception so domodroid will automatically reduce bitmaps exceeding 800*800px by âˆš2.

    Jpeg jpg Png and SVG format supported: 

To display SVG images, Domodroid use a modified version of the library svg-Android
( http://code.google.com/p/svg-android/ ).
This library supports a subset of the SVG Basic 1.1 specification. Typically, you can just load your vector artwork in Illustrator and then save it as a SVG file (selecting the SVG Basic 1.1 option when asked) and it will work fine. Inkscape does not have direct support for SVG Basic, but many drawings will just work when saved as SVG from Inkscape. These are the features of SVG Basic not supported:
Be careful, you must use "px" as unit because of a bug in float conversion in this parser. If you use "mm" or "in" it might not work. 

All text and font features.

Raster images (bitmaps).

Symbols, conditional processing.

Patterns.

Masks, filters and views.

Interactivity, linking, scripting and animation.

Arc commands in paths (work on this is in progress).
