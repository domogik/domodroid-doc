========================
Developers environnement
========================

.. todo::
    Explain how to install the complete environment using Eclipse/Android SDK/Mercurial repo and plugin
    
You can use a lot of tools.

Since 12/2015 we migrate to Android Studio for developement. Still using API 8 from android to ensure largest device compatibility.

3 libs are used:
	The android appcompat, for navigation drawer and other stuff;
	
	jeroMQ to make domodroid compatible with domogik MQ;
	
	Achartengine is used to make graph;

Until version 11

ECLIPSE is only one of them, but you can use a simple text  editor if you want.

Install Google SDK

Configure it to use git at this adress:
https://github.com/domogik/domodroid

If you have right access to the domodroid github source to write. Install Egit plugin in Eclipse. You need to add an ssh key to your account and add it to the Egit conf.
Once it his done import the project with ssh using "git" as username without password:
ssh://git@github.com/domogik/domodroid
